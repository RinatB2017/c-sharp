ASP.NET MVC Server for Terrarium. The server provides the API interface that clients interact with to get information about the ecosystem, provides a public site for getting stats on the system like top creatures, and stores information about user creations in a SQL backend database.

Terrarium is a continuation of the [.NET Terrarium project on CodePlex](https://terrarium2.codeplex.com/)
